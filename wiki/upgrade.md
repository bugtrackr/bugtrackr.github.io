## Backup

Before any update, it's highly recommended to make a backup. You only need to save folder `./database/`.

## Upgrade

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Spamty/Bumpy-Booby/releases/latest).
2. Delete all files from your webserver except the `./database/` directory.
3. Upload all new files to your webserver.
4. Open `./index.php` in your browser and the upgrade should begin automatically.
